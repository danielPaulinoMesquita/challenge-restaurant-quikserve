# Challenge QIKSERVE

Hi guys, it was a pleasure to participate in this challenge,
I was able to use my knowledge and learn new things, it was worth a lot.

# HOW TO START APPLICATION

### `npm install`

Up the project using: 
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# About the challenge

## ARCHITECTURE

I decided to follow the structure by `File Types`, I usually work with this type of structure, and also I tried to make more components.
I wanted to create tests for those components and service layer for api requests, but I didn't have time for that. I was focusing on to delivery more fast possible.

## MISTAKES

My first view, I have an opinion that will be not so difficult to do the challenge,
but I was coding and noticed that I made some wrong decisions, they are:

### - Only use CSS
The most of the time I prefer to use the pure css than libraries or frameworks css, reason of that,
it depends on the project and if it is really necessary for the project,
in this case, close to the final to done, it would be much better to use one framework like Tailwind or any other CSS library.

### - Mobile responsive
I wanted to use CSS at begin and later use some library CSS to adapt the project to mobile,
but it was a mistake, it was better to start using or already have to select one library to do that.

## CHALLENGES
### - Redux Toolkit
I have some challenges like using the 'redux toolkit', I am familiar with the oldest approach of redux, but it is good for me,
I was able to improve my knowledge in the control state and using the redux toolkit looks easier than others.

### - CSS in mobile version
As I mentioned, it was difficult to make mobile responsive,
I tried, but I didn't have time and I made a mistake when I chose not to use some library to do that.

### - CORS
I have this difficulty, I got one solution to test in local but the problem back in the production.

### - Deploy in prod
I choose the vercel, because it is easier to do that and free, for a while.
